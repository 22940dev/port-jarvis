Personal website of [@jakejarvis](https://github.com/jakejarvis), created and deployed using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [and more](https://jarv.is/humans.txt).

I keep an ongoing list of [post ideas](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/issues/1) and [coding to-dos](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/issues/11) as issues in this repo. Outside contributions, improvements, and/or corrections are welcome too!

## üíæ&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting a local development server

### üß∂&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Yarn:

Run `yarn install` and `yarn start`, then open [http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337/). ([Yarn must be installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) first; NPM _should_ also work at your own risk.) Hugo, [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) will automatically work together to build the site, and pages will live-refresh via [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) when source files are changed.

### ‚ñ≤&nbsp;&nbsp;Using [`vercel dev`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/dev):

The [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) is not included as a project dependency here, but [installing it globally](https://vercel.com/cli) (`npm i -g vercel`) and running `vercel dev` in this repository will build and serve the static site automatically via Yarn **as well as the [serverless functions](/api)** used in production. Pretty nifty! (Note: the CLI will usually start the server at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) instead of port 1337.)

### ü§Ø&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does this look _way_ more complex than it needs to be?!

[Because it is.](https://www.jvt.me/talks/overengineering-your-personal-website/)
