Personal website of [@jakejarvis](https://github.com/jakejarvis), created and deployed using the following:

- [Hugo extended](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows)
- [Commento](https://gitlab.com/commento/commento)

I keep an ongoing list of [blog post ideas](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/issues/1) as an issue in this repo.


## Running a local testing server with Docker

This site runs a [custom version](https://github.com/jakejarvis/hugo-custom) of [Hugo Extended](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) with a few (very opinionated) changes. To ensure consistency, the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) in this repository will pull my Hugo [fork](https://github.com/jakejarvis/hugo-custom) (forked from `v0.53-DEV`, [gohugo/hugo@`a28865c`](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/tree/a28865cfc3e296cf0ddd0bd6c1368fcdb2154d0f) and pre-built on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jakejarvis/hugo-custom) and [GitHub Package Registry](https://github.com/jakejarvis/hugo-custom/packages)) and run a live testing server.

Run these commands on the root of this repository:

```bash
docker build -t jarv.is:develop -f Dockerfile .
docker run -v $(pwd):/src -p 1313:1313 jarv.is:develop
```

...then open [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/). Pages will live-refresh when source files are changed.
