Personal website of [@jakejarvis](https://github.com/jakejarvis), created and deployed using the following:

- [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
- [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Matomo Analytics](https://matomo.org/)

I keep an ongoing list of [blog post ideas](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/issues/1) as an issue in this repo.


## Running a local testing server with Docker

This site runs a [custom version](https://github.com/jakejarvis/hugo) of [Hugo Extended](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) with a few (very opinionated) changes. To ensure consistency, the `Dockerfile` in this repository will pull my [pre-built](https://go.jarv.is/30KA6DS) Hugo fork (forked from `v0.53-DEV`, [gohugo/hugo@`a28865c`](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/tree/a28865cfc3e296cf0ddd0bd6c1368fcdb2154d0f)) and run a live testing server.

Run these commands on the root of this repository:

```bash
docker build -t jarv.is:develop -f Dockerfile .
docker run -v $(pwd):/src -p 1313:1313 jarv.is:develop
```

...then open [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/). Pages will live-refresh when source files are changed.
