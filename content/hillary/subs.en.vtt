00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.210
All right, well let's listen
here to the video at the Democratic

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.880
National Convention on this issue.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.340
You know, when I came here to New Hampshire

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.269
the first time in this campaign and
heard about the heroin epidemic

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.660
The growing drug problem in our area...

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.604
We're all losing fathers, brothers, sons, mothers...

00:00:19.604 --> 00:00:22.040
The numbers of people who are being affected

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.000
If you have been impacted by your own or
someone else's use of substances, would

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.510
you just raise your hand?

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.470
I didn't even know what was wrong with me until I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.400
found out that I was I was an addict.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.480
This problem touches everybody...

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.484
My children suffered, my family suffered...

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:44.280
Meeting grandmothers raising their grandchildren...

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.800
All of my friends are raising
their grandchildren because of addiction

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.700
I think you're very brave and
very loving to take on this responsibility.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.720
It is plaguing families.
I don't want to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.180
go to more funerals. I'm going to one this weekend.
I didn't know if I wanted

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.980
to do better. Addiction had full control
over my heart and soul.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.880
I wouldn't have necessarily known that if I hadn't been
sitting in a little cafe in Keene

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.140
listening to people tell me about what
was breaking their hearts and what they

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.660
wanted their president to know.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.299
We need the voice of those who are using, that is

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.480
the way in which we can make an impact
on this disease.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.860
We can't walk away from these stories.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.900
These are our children, these are our friends, our neighbors,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.160
our loved ones. This is not something we can
just brush under the rug and wish it would

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.180
go away. We need to drag it out of the
shadows, we need to hold it up to the light

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.740
Everybody should feel that they are

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:50.960
valued, they are cared about, and they
have a president who sees them
