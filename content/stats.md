This website uses [**Simple Analytics**](https://simpleanalytics.com/?ref=jarv.is) to tally pageviews without tracking you.

Cookies and fingerprinting are never used and your IP address is hidden behind [a serverless function](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/blob/main/functions/send_view.js) when your ping is anonymously proxied to Simple Analytics' API on your behalf. Refer to the [**Privacy Policy**](/privacy/) for a complete list of information sent.

In that case, why not share them? ðŸ˜Š Pageviews for the past month are graphed below and more information (top pages, referrers, etc.) can be found [on a publicly-accessible dashboard.](https://simpleanalytics.com/jarv.is?utm_source=jarv.is&utm_content=badge)
