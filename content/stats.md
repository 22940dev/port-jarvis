This website uses [**Fathom Analytics**](https://usefathom.com/ref/ZEYG0O) to tally pageviews without tracking you — cookies and fingerprinting are never used. Refer to Fathom's [data policy](https://usefathom.com/data) for a complete list of information sent.

In that case, why not share them? 😊 Pageviews for the past month are graphed below and more information (top pages, referrers, etc.) can be found [on a publicly-accessible dashboard](https://app.usefathom.com/share/ppsqzudy/jarv.is).
