["The Lab" Theme Music]

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.760
Welcome back to "The Lab with Leo," I'm Kate Abraham and now it's time for our

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.000
Facebook app of the day. And in honor of
the lovely Amber – wasn't it great to see Amber?

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.470
Oh, it was so nice to see her.
She's looking so tan!

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.140
Toronto weather.
Yeah, really? I think she was at Prince Edward Island for a few days

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.380
for Canada Day.
So she's out there like this, tanning in the ocean. Good for her.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.060
She knows how to enjoy herself.
[laughs]

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.740
So in honor of Amber, our Facebook app of the day is

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.360
Powncer, or Poncer or Punser

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.000
However you want to say it, I say Powncer.
So there's your Pownce page.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.520
So what you do is, basically, it literally updates your most recent post on Pownce.
So literally I've just put here

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.200
"Playing with Pownce," then if I just post this, and what will happen is it'll automatically

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.460
I bet you've done this in advance, it'll
automatically go through to my actual

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.420
site on Facebook and as you can see, you can see exactly what I'm doing

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.000
And then can they click that and takes
it to your Pownce page?
Yeah, then you can

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.860
reply to me. Oh that's neat!
Then what'll happen, you can basically send me a reply.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.460
You know who wrote that? I don't know.
Jake Jarvis wrote that.

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.560
And I know who Jake Jarvis is, he's on my
Facebook friends list.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.250
He's a young guy, I think he's a high school kid, the son of Jeff Jarvis, who's

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.450
a very well known media critic.
These kids freak me out. Isn't it neat?

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.590
Jake's written some great applications
How old is he?
I don't know, I think 16 or 17.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.100
That scares me.
He's written a lot, he's one of the best Facebook developers out there.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.310
Did a nice job with that.
That's fantastic.
Isn't that great? I love it, that's so good.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.860
But for more details, obviously Facebook
apps

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.080
I said facebook.com/apps.
There's lots of them, there's thousands.
So many on there.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.100
There's a lot of bad ones but some really good ones.
Well that's what you're here for, to tell us which ones are good.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.540
Exactly, this was a good one, I like it.
She installs them all so that you can

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.220
tell, you got like a page this long!
You just keep scrolling, scrolling, scrolling...
[laughs]
