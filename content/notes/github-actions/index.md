Since being accepted into the beta for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) a few months ago, I've found a new side hobby of whipping up new (and ideally creative) actions for anybody to add to their CI pipeline. Actions are modular steps that interact with a GitHub repository and can be coded with [Docker](https://github.com/actions/hello-world-docker-action) or [JavaScript/Node](https://github.com/actions/hello-world-javascript-action) ‚Äî¬†and either way, they can be as [simple](https://github.com/jakejarvis/wait-action) or as [complex](https://github.com/jakejarvis/lighthouse-action) as you want. But in both cases, they're incredibly fun to make and the results always scratch my itch for instant gratification.

My favorite so far is my [Lighthouse Audit action](https://github.com/jakejarvis/lighthouse-action), which spins up a headless Google Chrome instance in an Ubuntu container and runs [Google's Lighthouse tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), which scores webpages on performance, accessibility, SEO, etc. and provides actual suggestions to improve them. It's a perfect example of the power of combining containers with Git workflows.

It's also been a fantastic avenue to dip my feet into the collaborative nature of GitHub and the open-source community.¬†I've made some small apps in the past but these are the first projects where I'm regularly receiving new issues to help out with and impressive pull requests to merge. It's a great feeling!

Here are the actions I've made so far, sorted by popularity as of this posting:

- **[üí° üè† Lighthouse Audit](https://github.com/jakejarvis/lighthouse-action)** ‚Äî Run a [Google Chrome Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) audit on a webpage.
- **[üîÑ üß∫ S3 Bucket Sync](https://github.com/jakejarvis/s3-sync-action)** ‚Äî Sync/upload a directory with a remote AWS S3 bucket.
- **[üóëÔ∏è Cloudflare Purge Cache](https://github.com/jakejarvis/cloudflare-purge-action)** ‚Äî Purge a website's cache via the Cloudflare API.
- **[‚úèÔ∏è Hugo Build](https://github.com/jakejarvis/hugo-build-action)** ‚Äî The static site generator [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio) as an action, with support for legacy versions and extended features.
- **[üî• Firebase Deploy](https://github.com/jakejarvis/firebase-deploy-action)** ‚Äî Deploy a static site to [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).
- **[üîÑ Backblaze B2 Sync](https://github.com/jakejarvis/backblaze-b2-action)** ‚Äî  Sync a directory with a remote [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) storage bucket.
- **[üí§ Wait](https://github.com/jakejarvis/wait-action)** ‚Äî A very, very simple action to sleep for a given amount of time (10s, 2m, etc.)

As an example of an *extremely* simple (and almost completely unnecessary) action, the [Wait action](https://github.com/jakejarvis/wait-action) takes one input ‚Äî¬†a unit of time ‚Äî¬†and has the pipeline sleep for that amount of time. The [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/jakejarvis/wait-action/blob/master/Dockerfile) is as simple as this:

{{< gist id="6a0830c7c3e514980b30fdf86b4931c5" file="Dockerfile" >}}

...with a super-short [`entrypoint.sh`](https://github.com/jakejarvis/wait-action/blob/master/entrypoint.sh):

{{< gist id="6a0830c7c3e514980b30fdf86b4931c5" file="entrypoint.sh" >}}

Using an action is also surprisingly simple, and more intuitive than [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), in my humble opinion. Pipelines in GitHub Actions are called ["workflows,"](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow) and live in a file with [YAML syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) in `.github/workflows`. An example of a `workflow.yml` file that uses the above action to wait 10 seconds (on both pushes and pull requests) would look something like:

{{< gist id="6a0830c7c3e514980b30fdf86b4931c5" file="workflow.yml" >}}

For a more complex example, when I forked [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) (the static site generator used to build this website) to make some small personalized changes, I also translated [their `.travis.yml` file](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/.travis.yml) into a [`workflow.yml` file](https://github.com/jakejarvis/hugo-custom/blob/master/.github/workflows/workflow.yml) for practice, which simultaneously runs comprehensive unit tests on **three operating systems** (Ubuntu 18.04, Windows 10, and macOS 10.14) with the latest two Go versions *each!* If the tests are all successful, it builds a Docker image and pushes it to both [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jakejarvis/hugo-custom) and the [GitHub Package Registry](https://github.com/jakejarvis/hugo-custom/packages) (also [in beta](https://github.com/features/package-registry)).

{{< image src="images/hugo-logs.png" alt="Build logs for my Hugo fork" />}}

Then another workflow, which [lives in this website's repository](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is/blob/master/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml), pulls that Docker image, builds the Hugo site, and pushes it to GitHub Pages. All astoundingly fast. All for free.

A plethora of actions is already published on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions), with dozens more being added every week. If you are not yet in the beta, I urge you to [sign up here](https://github.com/features/actions) and give it a shot. GitHub has been very [receptive to feedback](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/bd-p/actions) (so far) and I can't wait to see GitHub Actions evolve into an enterprise-grade CI tool at the level of other competitors in this space. ‚ù§Ô∏è
