A few months ago, I stumbled upon [my first website ever](/y2k/) on an old floppy disk. Despite the instant cringing, I uploaded it to GitHub, [collected other iterations](/previously/), and made an [#awesome-list](https://github.com/jakejarvis/awesome-first-code) of others who were brave and/or shameless enough to do the same. But why not take that ~~one~~ 1,000 steps further?

Introducing [**y2k.land**](https://y2k.land/) ‚Äî¬†with fully-featured, fully-isolated, on-demand Windows Millennium Edition¬Æ virtual machines, simply to experience my first website in its natural Internet Explorer 5 habitat. And maybe play some [3D Pinball: Space Cadet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Tilt!_Pinball#3D_Pinball_for_Windows_%E2%80%93_Space_Cadet). Oh, and [Microsoft Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob) is there too if you want to say hello and catch up.

The backend is powered by [**QEMU**](https://www.qemu.org/), [**websocketd**](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd), and some messy Ruby and shell scripts. I'll push it up to GitHub [next to the frontend code](https://github.com/jakejarvis/y2k) (which is based on [**noVNC**](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC)) once I have a chance to untangle the spaghetti code. üçù

I must give credit to both [charlie.bz](https://charlie.bz/) and [benjojo.co.uk](https://benjojo.co.uk/) here, similar websites I was enamored with when they were posted on Hacker News a few years ago. Think we'll see some websites like these with Windows 29 in a decade?

Either way, quarantine boredom is a crazy thing, am I right? üò∑
